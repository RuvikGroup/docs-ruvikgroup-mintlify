# Infrastructure

This page details the specific infrastructure setup, deployment pipeline, and technical architecture for the My Best Pic application.

## Current Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
<Card title="Flutter Mobile App" icon="mobile">
  **Technology**: Flutter  
  **Platform**: Cross-platform (iOS & Android)  
  **Deployment**: Codemagic CI/CD  
  **Build Process**: Automated builds triggered by Git commits
</Card>

### Backend Architecture
<Card title="Laravel API Backend" icon="server">
  **Technology**: Laravel (PHP Framework)  
  **Deployment**: Chipper CI  
  **Database**: Traditional SQL database  
  **Migration Plan**: Moving to Supabase (timeline TBD)
</Card>

## Deployment Pipeline

### Frontend Deployment (Codemagic)
<Steps>
  <Step title="Code Commit">
    Developer pushes code to GitHub repository
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automated Build">
    Codemagic triggers build process for Flutter app
  </Step>
  <Step title="Testing">
    Automated tests run (if configured)
  </Step>
  <Step title="App Store Deployment">
    Built app deployed to iOS App Store and Google Play Store
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Backend Deployment (Chipper CI)
<Steps>
  <Step title="Code Commit">
    Backend code pushed to repository
  </Step>
  <Step title="Chipper CI Build">
    Chipper CI processes the Laravel application
  </Step>
  <Step title="Server Deployment">
    Application deployed to production servers
  </Step>
  <Step title="Database Migration">
    Any database schema changes applied
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Database Architecture

### Current Database Setup
- **Type**: Traditional SQL database (specific type TBD)
- **Management**: Laravel Eloquent ORM
- **Migrations**: Laravel migration system
- **Schema**: [Database Schema Documentation](/my-best-pic/architecture/database-schema)

### Planned Migration to Supabase
<Warning>
Migration to Supabase is planned but timeline is not yet determined. This will involve:
- Data migration from current database
- API endpoint updates
- Authentication system changes
- Real-time features implementation
</Warning>

## API Architecture

### Current API Structure
- **Framework**: Laravel with GraphQL
- **Authentication**: Laravel authentication system
- **Data Format**: GraphQL API
- **Documentation**: [API Structure Guide](/my-best-pic/architecture/api-structure)

## Environment Configuration

### Development Environment
```bash
# Local development requirements
- Flutter SDK
- Laravel development server
- Database connection (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- PHP 8.0+
- Composer package manager
```

### Production Environment
- **Frontend**: Mobile app stores (iOS App Store, Google Play)
- **Backend**: Web servers running Laravel
- **Database**: Production database server
- **CDN**: (To be documented)

## Monitoring & Logging

<Accordion title="Monitoring Setup">
Current monitoring setup:
- **Application Logs**: Laravel logging system
- **Error Tracking**: (To be documented)
- **Performance Monitoring**: (To be documented)
- **Uptime Monitoring**: (To be documented)

*This section needs to be expanded with specific monitoring tools and setup instructions.*
</Accordion>

## Security Considerations

### Current Security Measures
- Laravel security features (CSRF protection, SQL injection prevention)
- Authentication and authorization layers
- HTTPS enforcement

### Post-Supabase Security
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- JWT token-based authentication
- API rate limiting
- Built-in security features

## Backup & Recovery

<Note>
Backup and recovery procedures need to be documented. This should include:
- Database backup schedules
- Application data backup
- Recovery procedures
- Disaster recovery plan
</Note>

## Performance Considerations

### Current Performance Setup
- Laravel caching mechanisms
- Database query optimization
- API response caching

### Optimization Opportunities
- CDN implementation for static assets
- Database indexing optimization
- API response time monitoring
- Mobile app performance profiling

## Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**: Developers work with local Laravel and Flutter setup
2. **Feature Branches**: Code developed in feature branches
3. **Pull Requests**: Code review process through GitHub
4. **Automated Testing**: (To be implemented if not already in place)
5. **Staging Deployment**: Test deployments before production
6. **Production Release**: Coordinated deployment of frontend and backend

## Migration Timeline & Planning

<Steps>
  <Step title="Phase 1: Planning">
    - Detailed migration plan creation
    - Data mapping and transformation planning
    - Timeline establishment
  </Step>
  <Step title="Phase 2: Development">
    - Supabase backend setup
    - API endpoint migration
    - Authentication system updates
  </Step>  
  <Step title="Phase 3: Testing">
    - Comprehensive testing of migrated system
    - Performance validation
    - Security audit
  </Step>
  <Step title="Phase 4: Deployment">
    - Data migration execution
    - Production cutover
    - Post-migration monitoring
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting & Support
