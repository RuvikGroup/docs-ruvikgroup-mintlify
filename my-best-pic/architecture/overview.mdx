# Architecture Overview

This page provides a comprehensive overview of the My Best Pic application architecture, including system design, technology choices, and how different components work together.

## Application Overview

My Best Pic is a professional photo management and organization platform designed for photographers, creative professionals, and businesses that need to manage large collections of visual content.

### Core Features
- **Photo Organization**: Categorize and organize photo collections
- **Subject Management**: Tag and track subjects across collections
- **Depiction Tracking**: Manage how subjects are portrayed in images
- **Credit Attribution**: Track licensing and attribution information

## System Architecture

    - Rich media handling capabilities
  </Card>
  <Card title="Backend API" icon="server">
    **Laravel + GraphQL**
    - Flexible data querying with GraphQL
    - Laravel framework for robust backend
    - Efficient photo metadata management
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Technology Stack

### Frontend Technologies
- **Flutter Framework**: Cross-platform mobile development
- **Dart Language**: Client-side application logic
- **GraphQL Client**: Efficient data fetching and caching
- **Platform Integrations**: Camera, gallery, and file system access

### Backend Technologies
- **Laravel Framework**: PHP-based backend framework
- **GraphQL API**: Flexible query language for data access
- **Database**: Traditional SQL database for structured data
- **File Storage**: Photo and media asset management

## Data Flow Architecture

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Interaction">
    User interacts with Flutter mobile application
  </Step>
  <Step title="GraphQL Queries">
    App sends GraphQL queries/mutations to Laravel backend
  </Step>
  <Step title="Data Processing">
    Laravel processes requests and interacts with database
  </Step>
  <Step title="Response">
    Structured data returned via GraphQL to mobile app
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Why Flutter?
- **Cross-platform efficiency**: Single codebase for iOS and Android
- **Performance**: Near-native performance for media-heavy applications
- **Rich UI capabilities**: Excellent for photo management interfaces

### Why GraphQL?
- **Flexible querying**: Clients can request exactly the data they need
- **Type safety**: Strong typing reduces integration errors
- **Efficient**: Reduces over-fetching of data for mobile applications

### Why Laravel?
- **Rapid development**: Rich ecosystem and built-in features
- **GraphQL integration**: Excellent GraphQL libraries available
- **Scalable**: Proven framework for growing applications

## Infrastructure Architecture

For detailed infrastructure information including deployment pipelines, environment setup, and operational considerations, see the [Infrastructure Documentation](/my-best-pic/architecture/infrastructure).

### High-Level Infrastructure
- **Mobile Deployment**: Codemagic CI/CD for app store releases
- **Backend Deployment**: Chipper CI for server deployments
- **Development Environment**: Local Flutter + Laravel development stack

## Security Architecture

### Current Security Measures
- **Authentication**: Laravel-based user authentication
- **API Security**: GraphQL query validation and rate limiting
- **Data Protection**: Secure handling of photo metadata and user data
- **Mobile Security**: Platform-specific security features (iOS/Android)

## Performance Considerations

### Mobile App Performance
- **Image Optimization**: Efficient loading and caching of photos
- **GraphQL Caching**: Client-side caching for frequently accessed data
- **Background Processing**: Async operations for non-blocking UX

### Backend Performance
- **GraphQL Optimization**: Query complexity analysis and optimization
- **Database Indexing**: Optimized queries for photo search and filtering
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis/Memcached for frequently accessed data

## Future Architecture Evolution

<Note>
Migration to Supabase is planned but timeline is not yet determined. This will involve significant architectural changes to backend services and data management.
</Note>

### Current State vs. Future State
- **Current**: Laravel + Traditional Database + Custom GraphQL implementation
- **Future**: Supabase + Auto-generated APIs + Real-time capabilities

## Development Architecture

### Code Organization
- **Frontend**: Flutter app with feature-based module organization
- **Backend**: Laravel with GraphQL schema and resolver organization
- **Shared**: API contracts and data models

### Development Workflow
1. Feature development in separate branches
2. Code review via GitHub pull requests
3. Automated testing (where implemented)
4. Staging deployments for testing
5. Production releases via CI/CD pipelines

## Integration Points

### External Services
- **App Stores**: iOS App Store and Google Play Store distribution
- **File Storage**: Cloud storage for photo assets
- **Analytics**: User behavior and performance tracking (to be documented)

### Internal Integrations
- **User Management**: Authentication and user profile management
- **Photo Processing**: Image optimization and metadata extraction
- **Search Functionality**: Full-text search across photo collections

## Monitoring & Observability

<Tip>
For detailed monitoring, logging, and operational procedures, see the [Operations Documentation](/my-best-pic/operations/monitoring).
</Tip>

Current observability includes:
- Application logging via Laravel
- Mobile app crash reporting
- Performance monitoring (to be expanded)
