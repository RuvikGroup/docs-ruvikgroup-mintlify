## Introduction

This document outlines the branch naming conventions for all repositories within the Ruvik Group organization, specifically tailored for use with GitHub Issues and Projects.

## General Rules

- Use lowercase letters
- Use hyphens (-) to separate words
- Be concise but descriptive
- Include relevant GitHub issue numbers where applicable

## Branch Types

We use the following branch types:

1. `feature`: For developing new features
2. `bugfix`: For fixing bugs
3. `hotfix`: For quick fixes to production code
4. `release`: For release preparation
5. `refactor`: For code refactoring
6. `docs`: For documentation updates
7. `test`: For adding or updating tests

## Naming Format

The general format for branch names is:

```
<type>/<issue-number>-<short-description>
```

- `<type>`: One of the branch types listed above
- `<issue-number>`: The associated GitHub issue number (without leading zeros)
- `<short-description>`: A brief, hyphen-separated description

## Examples

- `feature/42-add-user-authentication`
- `bugfix/123-fix-login-error`
- `hotfix/456-patch-security-vulnerability`
- `release/v1.2.3`
- `refactor/789-improve-performance`
- `docs/234-update-api-documentation`
- `test/567-add-unit-tests-for-auth`

## Best Practices

1. Keep branch names short and meaningful
2. Always use the issue number when working on a GitHub issue
3. Delete branches after they've been merged
4. Regularly update your local repository to clean up deleted remote branches
5. Avoid using personal names or usernames in branch names

## Integration with GitHub Issues and Projects

1. Always include the GitHub issue number in the branch name when working on an issue
2. Use the exact issue number as it appears in GitHub (e.g., '42' for issue #42)
3. When creating a pull request, use the GitHub feature to link it to the related issue
4. In commit messages, use GitHub's syntax to reference issues:
   - Use `#<issue-number>` to reference an issue within the same repository
   - Use `<organization>/<repo>#<issue-number>` for cross-repository references
5. Take advantage of GitHub's automation features:
   - Use keywords like "Fixes #42" or "Closes #42" in pull request descriptions to automatically close issues when merged
   - Utilize GitHub Actions to automate workflows based on branch names

## Handling Exceptions

While consistency is crucial, there may be situations where strict adherence to the naming convention is impractical. In such cases:

1. Consult with the team lead or repository administrator
2. Document the reason for the exception in the related issue or pull request
3. Try to stay as close to the convention as possible

Remember, the goal of this naming convention is to improve clarity and efficiency in our development process while leveraging GitHub's features. When in doubt, choose a name that clearly communicates the purpose of the branch to your team members and integrates well with our GitHub workflow.
