## Introduction

This document outlines the naming conventions for repositories within the Ruvik Group GitHub organization. Consistent naming helps maintain organization, improves searchability, and clarifies the purpose of each repository.

## General Rules

- Use all lowercase letters
- Use hyphens (-) to separate words
- Avoid abbreviations unless widely recognized
- Be concise but descriptive

## Package Repositories

### Format
`pkg-[name]-[platform]`

### Rules
- Use the `pkg-` prefix to identify package repositories
- `[name]` should concisely describe the package's primary function
- `[platform]` specifies the technology or framework (e.g., flutter, php)

### Examples
- pkg-auth-flutter
- pkg-onboarding-flutter
- pkg-analytics-flutter
- pkg-ui-flutter

## Application Repositories

### Format
`app-[name]-[component]`

### Rules
- Use the `app-` prefix to identify application repositories
- `[name]` should be the application's name or a short identifier
- `[component]` specifies whether it's frontend or backend (e.g., flutter, laravel)

### Examples
- app-mybestpic-flutter
- app-mybestpic-laravel

## Documentation Repositories

### Format
`docs-[subject]`

### Rules
- Use the `docs-` prefix to identify documentation repositories
- `[subject]` should concisely describe the documentation content

### Examples
- docs-organization
- docs-api
- docs-style-guide

## Infrastructure and DevOps Repositories

### Format
`infra-[purpose]`

### Rules
- Use the `infra-` prefix to identify infrastructure-related repositories
- `[purpose]` should describe the specific infrastructure or DevOps function

### Examples
- infra-ci-cd
- infra-monitoring
- infra-deployment

## Best Practices

1. Consistency: Always follow the naming schema for new repositories
2. Descriptiveness: Choose names that clearly convey the repository's purpose
3. Brevity: Keep names as short as possible while maintaining clarity
4. Avoid Redundancy: Don't repeat information that's already in the organization name or prefix
5. Future-proofing: Consider how the name might accommodate future changes or expansions

## Examples

Here are some examples of full GitHub URLs using this naming schema:

- https://github.com/Ruvik/pkg-auth-flutter
- https://github.com/Ruvik/app-mybestpic-flutter
- https://github.com/Ruvik/docs-api
- https://github.com/Ruvik/infra-ci-cd

## Handling Exceptions

While consistency is important, there may be cases where strict adherence to the naming schema is impractical. In such cases:

1. Consult with the team lead or repository administrator
2. Document the reason for the exception
3. Try to stay as close to the schema as possible

## Updating Existing Repositories

When renaming existing repositories to comply with this schema:

1. Create a plan for the transition
2. Update all references in code and documentation
3. Set up redirects from old names if possible
4. Inform all team members of the changes
5. Update any CI/CD pipelines or scripts that reference the repository names

Remember, consistency in your repository names will greatly enhance the organization and navigability of your GitHub workspace.
