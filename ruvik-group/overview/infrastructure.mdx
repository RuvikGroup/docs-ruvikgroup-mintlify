# Infrastructure Overview

This page provides a high-level overview of Ruvik Group's infrastructure approach and standards. For detailed product-specific infrastructure information, see the individual product documentation sections.

## Infrastructure Philosophy

Ruvik Group follows a **product-specific infrastructure** approach, where each product has its own tailored infrastructure setup based on its specific requirements and technology stack.

## Technology Stack Overview

### Frontend Standards
- **Primary Technology**: Flutter for cross-platform mobile development
- **Deployment**: Codemagic CI/CD for mobile app builds and releases

### Backend Approach
- **Current Mix**: Laravel (legacy) + Supabase (modern)
- **Migration Strategy**: Moving towards Supabase for consistency and modern features

## Product Infrastructure

  </Card>
  <Card title="Jubley Infrastructure" icon="database">

## Common Infrastructure Standards

### CI/CD Standards
- **Codemagic**: Primary CI/CD platform for Flutter applications
- **Chipper CI**: Used for specific backend deployments (My Best Pic)
- **Automated Testing**: Integrated into deployment pipelines where applicable

### Development Environment Standards
- **Version Control**: GitHub for all repositories
- **Project Management**: GitHub Projects for issue tracking
- **Communication**: Discord for team coordination
