## Best Practices

### Writing Good PR Descriptions

1. **Be Clear and Concise**: Explain what changed and why
2. **Link Issues**: Always reference related issues
3. **Include Context**: Help reviewers understand the background
4. **List Testing Steps**: Make it easy to verify your changes
5. **Add Screenshots**: Visual changes should include before/after

### PR Title Format

Follow this format for PR titles:
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

Examples:
feat(auth): add OAuth2 integration
fix(upload): resolve memory leak in image processor
docs(api): update endpoint documentation
chore(deps): upgrade to React 18
```

### Types
- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks

### Review Process

1. **Self-Review First**: Check your own code before requesting reviews
2. **Address All Comments**: Respond to or resolve all review comments
3. **Keep PRs Small**: Easier to review and less likely to introduce bugs
4. **Update Often**: Keep your branch up to date with the base branch
