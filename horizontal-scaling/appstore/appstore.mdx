### Important: Age Ratings Configuration

Missed this information in the video but you need to do age ratings too.\
Select "None" or "No" for all content ratings unless something genuinely applies (which for our dating app, it typically doesn't).

- Set the age rating to 17\+.
- Confirm your selections before submission.
