## Deep Linking and Asset Links

### Step 12: Configure Asset Links

#### 12a. Configure Apple App Site Association

- Create or update `web/.well-known/apple-app-site-association` file
- Configure the app ID and URL patterns for iOS deep linking:

**Apple App Site Association File Structure:**

```json
{
  "applinks": {
    "details": [
      {
        "appID": "[TEAM_ID].com.<brandname>.app",
        "paths": ["*"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Configuration Details:**

- **appID**: Format is `[TEAM_ID].[BUNDLE_ID]`
  - `[TEAM_ID]`: Your Apple Developer Team ID
  - `com.<brandname>.app`: Your app's bundle identifier
- **paths**: URL patterns to handle (use `["*"]` for all paths)

**Where to find your Team ID:**

- Apple Developer Account → Membership → Team ID
- Or in Xcode → Project Settings → Signing & Capabilities

#### 12b. Configure Android Asset Links

- Create or update `web/.well-known/assetlinks.json` file
- Configure the package name and certificate fingerprints for Android deep linking:

![Android Asset Links](/images/assetlinks.png)

**Android Asset Links File Structure:**

```json
[
  {
    "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"],
    "target": {
      "namespace": "android_app",
      "package_name": "com.<brandname>.app",
      "sha256_cert_fingerprints": ["[SHA256_FINGERPRINT]"]
    }
  }
]
```

**Configuration Details:**

- **package_name**: Your Android app's package name (must match `android/app/build.gradle`)
- **sha256_cert_fingerprints**: SHA-256 fingerprints of your app's signing certificates

**How to get SHA-256 fingerprints:**

**From Google Play Console (Required for Asset Links):**

- Go to Google Play Console → Your App → Setup → App Integrity
- Copy the SHA-256 certificate fingerprint from "App signing key certificate"
- **This is the ONLY valid fingerprint for asset links** - Google Play manages app signing

**Important:** The SHA-256 fingerprint MUST come from Google Play Console, not from your local keystore. Google Play uses its own signing key for published apps, so local debug/release certificate fingerprints will not work for deep linking verification.

#### 12c. Deploy Asset Links

- Place both files in `web/.well-known/` directory:
  - `web/.well-known/apple-app-site-association` (no file extension)
  - `web/.well-known/assetlinks.json`
- Ensure these files are accessible at:
  - `https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association`
  - `https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/assetlinks.json`

**Important Notes:**

- Files must be served over HTTPS
- `apple-app-site-association` file must NOT have a file extension
- Both files must return `Content-Type: application/json`
- Test the links after deployment to ensure they're publicly accessible
