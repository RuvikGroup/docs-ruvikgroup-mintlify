# Creating a New Project

Supabase provides the backend for your application. Here's how to configure it for a new brand.

- Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/dashboard) website and sign in.
- Select the `RuvikGroup` organization at the top left in the dashboard.
- Click on `New project` to create a new project.

> Make sure `RuvikGroup` organization is selected

- Click on `Create new project` to start creating the project. This can take a couple of minutes.

## Connecting Supabase CLI

To connect your local project to your new Supabase project, you'll need to use the Supabase CLI.

### 1. Log in to the CLI

If you haven't already, log in to your Supabase account:

```bash
supabase login
```

This will open a browser window for you to authenticate.

### 2. Link your project

You need your project's reference ID to link it. You can find this in your project's dashboard URL (`https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/<project-ref>`) or in `Project Settings` > `General`.

Run the following command, replacing `<project-ref>` with your actual project reference ID:

```bash
supabase link --project-ref <project-ref>
```

The CLI will prompt you for your database password, which you can find in `Project Settings` > `Database`.

After linking, your local setup will be connected to your remote Supabase project, allowing you to manage migrations, deploy Edge Functions, and set secrets.
