title: "Applying Database Migrations"
description: "The project comes with a set of pre-existing database migrations. Once you have linked your local project to your Supabase project, you must apply these migrations to set up your database schema correctly."

## Applying Existing Migrations

To apply all existing migrations to your remote Supabase database, run the following command from your project's root directory:

```bash
supabase db push
```

The Supabase CLI will connect to your remote database and execute all the migration files located in the `supabase/migrations` directory that have not yet been applied.

This command ensures that your database schema is correctly set up according to the base application's requirements.

**Important:** You should not need to create new migrations or edit existing ones for the initial setup. The necessary schema is already defined in the existing migration files.
